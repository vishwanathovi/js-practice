Use index.html annd do the following:
 
1. Add a script tag to the bottom.
2. Change the body style so it has a font-family of "Arial, sans-serif".
3. Replace each of the spans (nickname, favorites, hometown) with your own information.
4. Iterate through each li and change the class to "listitem". Add a style tag that sets a rule for "listitem" to make the color red.
5. Create a new img element and set its src attribute to a picture of you. Append that element to the page.
