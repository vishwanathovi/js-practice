//1. Write a function that loops through the numbers n down to 0.




//2. Write a function countTo that takes one argument limit and prints number from 0 to limit



//3. Write a function 'exponent' that takes two arguments base, and expo,
//uses a while loop to return the exponenet value of the base.




//4. Write a function factorial that take 1 argument 'number' and gives the factorial of the number.




//5. Write a function 'RecursiveExponent' that takes two arguments base, and expo, recursively returns exponent value of the base.



//6. Write a function 'recursiveMultiplier' that takes two arguments, 'arr and num'
// and multiplies each arr value into by num and returns an array of the values.



// 7. Write a function 'recursiveReverse' that takes an array and uses recursion
// to return its contents in reverse
