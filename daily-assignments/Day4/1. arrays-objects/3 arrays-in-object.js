// 1. Add a new property to your penguin called favoriteFoods and set it equal to an array containing a list of three strings.

myPenguin.favoriteFoods = ["Fish","Big Fish","Biggest Fish"]

// 2. Access your penguin's second favorite food and print it to the console using console.log()

console.log(myPenguin.favoriteFoods[1])

// 3. Create a new variable called firstFavFood and set it equal to the first item in your penguin's array of favorite foods.

var firstFavFood = myPenguin.favoriteFoods[0];

// 4. Add another food to the end of the list.

myPenguin.favoriteFoods.push("Shrimp")

// 5. Print the length of your penguin's favoriteFoods array to the console with console.log()

console.log(myPenguin.favoriteFoods.length)

// 6. Without modifying any of your previous code, write a new line of code that changes the value of the last item in the list to "pineapples" (overwriting the previous value).

myPenguin.favoriteFoods[myPenguin.favoriteFoods.length-1] = "pineapples"

// 7. Create a new variable named lastFavFood that will always point to the last element of your penguin's favoriteFoods array, no matter how many items are in the list. (Hint: this is essentially the same problem as step 18 from above.)

var lastFavFood = myPenguin.favoriteFoods[myPenguin.favoriteFoods.length-1];

//8. Write a for loop to iterate through every food in your penguin's favoriteFood property and print each one to the console. (Hint: This loop will look exactly the same as the one you wrote for step 16 above, except now you're accessing the array as a property of an object.)

for (item of myPenguin.favoriteFoods){
	console.log(item)
}
