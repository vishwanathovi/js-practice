//For these last few challenges, I'll create three penguins for you to work with. Copy-paste this code snippet to the end of your code:

var gunter = {
  name: "Gunter",
  origin: "Adventure Time",
  canFly: false,
  sayHello: function() {
    console.log("QUACK!!!");
  },
};

var ramon = {
  name: "Ramón",
  origin: "Happy Feet",
  canFly: true,
  sayHello: function() {
    console.log("Estoy encantado de conocerle.");
  },
};

var fred = {
  name: "Fred",
  origin: "Sitting Ducks",
  canFly: false,
  sayHello: function() {
    console.log("Hi there!");
  },
};


// 1.Create a new variable named penguins and set it equal to an array that lists these three penguins! (Hint: remember you can put variable names inside an array, not just hard-coded values! And remember that variable names don't have quotes around them.)

var penguins = [gunter, ramon, fred];

// 2. Access the first penguin in the list and print it to the console using console.log() -- notice that you can see all the properties and methods of that object listed in the console! (Hint: remember that array indexes start counting at 0, not 1!)

console.log(penguins[0]);

// 3.Create a new variable called secondPenguin and set it equal to the second penguin in your penguins array.

var secondPenguin = penguins[1];

// 4 Print to the console the name of the last penguin in the list.

console.log(penguins[penguins.length - 1]);

// 5. Remember the penguin you created earlier, with the variable name of myPenguin? Add that penguin to the end of the penguins array!

penguins.push(myPenguin);


// 6. Print the length of the penguins array to the console.

console.log(penguins.length);

// 7. Write one more line of code to change the first penguin's canFly property to the value true (overriding its existing value).

penguins[0].canFly = true;

// 8.Call the sayHello method of the first penguin in your penguins array!

penguins[0].sayHello();

// 9.Write a for loop to iterate through every penguin in the array and print the value of each penguin's name property to the console.

for (var item of penguins) {
  console.log(item.name);
}

// 10.Write a for loop to call the sayHello method of every penguin in the array!

for (var item of penguins) {
  item.sayHello();
}

// 11.Write a for loop to iterate through every penguin in the array, and add a new property to each penguin called numberOfFeet with the value 2

for (var item of penguins) {
  item.numberOfFeet = 2;
}


// 12.Write another for loop to iterate through every penguin in the array, and for each penguin that can fly, print to the console a message containing the penguin's name and " can fly!" -- for example, "Gunter can fly!" or "Ramón can fly!" (Don't do anything for the penguins that cannot fly.)


for (var item of penguins) {
  if (item.canFly) {
    console.log(`${item.name} can fly!`);
  }
}
